# Ball following a parameterization of the trefoil in euclidean 3 space.

#### Could be great waiting animation.

#### To view this animation:

#### - view it live at <https://georgercarder.com/trefoil>

#### or

#### - clone the repository, `npm install` then `node server` and open browser to `localhost:4000`. Enjoy!

##### When used as waiting animation: If dev wants to stop animation after wait, put `clearInterval(window.Trefoil.setParamsInterval)`.
